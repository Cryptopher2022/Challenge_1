# Challenge_1
This is the first homework assignment to be turned in by March 27, 2022. 
It is a program designed to evaluate the value via criteria selected by the user. 
Each section of the program builds on another until the Present Value (fair_value) is
determined and compared against the Future Value found in the dictionary of loan information 
provided by the user.  
The program then uses user selected criteria for hurdle rate (discount_rate) at which the loans
are to be compared.  
The program then loops through each individual loan in the portolio of loans to evaluate against 
further input criteria selected by the User.  In this case, "Cost" of the loan is less than or 
equal to $500.  
The results are obtained and printed in real time and also exported to a CSV file called
"inexpensive_loans.csv" where the data header is placed at the top and each loan that passed
the evaluation criteria is displayed.  
During the exercise of building this program, the original program loan_analyzer_1.py was corrupted and 
was saved as a new file called loan_analyzer_1a.py.
